👋 Hi, I’m Oliver Bailey

I’m a student at the University of Sheffield with a growing focus on artificial intelligence. Most of my work sits at the intersection of Python development and lower-level C++ projects, where I enjoy building systems that are both practical and computationally interesting.

##🧠 Interests & Focus

Artificial intelligence and machine learning

Neural networks and algorithmic design

Game development and interactive systems

##💻 Technical Skills

###Advanced: Python
— numpy, pandas, tkinter, pygame, matplotlib

Intermediate: Java, C++

##🔨 Current Projects

Expanding my chess engine with a fully-integrated AI opponent

Continuing development of my C++ neural network project

##🎯 What I’m Working Toward

I’m aiming to deepen my understanding of AI and eventually specialise in intelligent systems and machine learning applications.
